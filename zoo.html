		<summary>Rust in embedded systems</summary>
		<p>
			<dfn>Rust</dfn> is a programming language that may be very hard to adapt as the <dfn>lingua franca</dfn> in
			embedded systems programming due to its large scope.
			The <dfn>C</dfn> programming language, while it doesn't offer nearly as many features to aid in ergonomics
			and <em>safety</em>, is much simpler to implement by a one-man team.
		</p>
		<p>
			Indeed, there may be value in making a "lighter" Rust, perhaps adopting a <dfn>linear type system</dfn>.

				If planes were flown like we write code, we'd have daily crashes, of course, but beyond that, the
				response to every plane crash would be: "only a bad pilot blames their plane! If they'd read
				subparagraph 71 of section 7.1.5.5 of the C++, er, 737 spec, they'd know that at 13:51 PM on the vernal
				equinox the wings fall off the plane."
			</p>
			<p>
				This doesn't happen in aviation, because in aviation we have decided, correctly, that <em>human error is
				an intrinsic and inseparable part of human activity</em>. And so we have built concentric layers of
				mechanical checks and balances around pilots, to take on part of the load of flying. Because humans are
				tired, they are burned out, they have limited focus, limited working memory, they are traumatized by
				writing executable YAML, <em>etc</em>.
